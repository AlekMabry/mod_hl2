To play this game, clone it into your sourcemods directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods). You will find this directory in the same folder as the commons folder (with all the other games). You will need to have Source SDK 2013 Singleplayer Base installed in order to play. Then, restart steam and the game will be there. To update your copy of the game, simply run git sync (if you are using git desktop). You will not have to restart steam for subsequent updates.
